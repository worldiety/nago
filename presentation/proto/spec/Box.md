A Box aligns children elements in absolute within its bounds.
 - there is no intrinsic component dimension, so you have to set it by hand
 - z-order is defined as defined children order, thus later children are put on top of others
 - it is undefined behavior, to define multiple children with the same alignment. So this must not be rendered.
