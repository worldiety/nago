An HStack aligns children elements in a horizontal row.
 - the intrinsic component dimensions are the sum of all sizes of the contained children
 - the parent can define a custom width and height
 - if the container is larger than the contained views, it must center vertical or horizontal
 - the inner gap between components should be around 2dp (this decides the backend)
