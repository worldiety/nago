ConfigurationRequested is issued by the frontend to get the applications general configuration.
A backend developer has potentially defined a lot of configuration details about the application.
For example, there may be a color theme, customized icons, image resources, an application name and the available set of navigations, launch intents or other meta information.
It is expected, that this only happens once during initialization of the frontend process.
