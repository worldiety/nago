StylePreset allows to apply a build-in style to this component. This reduces over-the-wire boilerplate and
also defines a stereotype, so that the applied component behavior may be indeed a bit different, because
a native component may be used, e.g. for a native button. The order of appliance is first the preset and
then customized properties on top.
