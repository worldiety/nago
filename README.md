# nago

## linter

This project just uses go vet.
Launch it from the module root as follows.

```bash
go vet ./...
```

## code generation

The typescript and go protocol is autogenerated based upon the nprotoc (_nago protocol compiler_) json specification.
After changing the source code, ensure that it still works properly by executing the nprotoc compiler from the module
root:

```bash
go generate ./...
```


## frontend development

The frontend is a regular vuejs project. 
If you change the source, you have to build the dist and commit it properly, otherwise the nago version will be broken.

```shell
cd web/vuejs
npm install
npm run build
```

For development and hot reloading use the npm run dev

```shell
cd web/vuejs
npm install
npm run dev
```

Note, that you need a `.env.local` with the following default settings

```bash
VITE_HOST_BACKEND=
VITE_WS_BACKEND_PORT=3000
```

Then launch the backend:

```shell
go run ./example/cmd/tutorial-01-helloworld
```

## Prod und Dev Ports

The default production setting serves the precompiled VueJS build from http://localhost:3000

When using the vite development build with hot reloading, you need to use http://localhost:8090
