Utility components provide supporting functionality, styling, or configuration for other components. They are often used to apply design tokens, manage behavior, or enhance developer experience.

This category also includes **conditional rendering utilities** that control the visibility and repetition of UI elements based on logic or data.

## Examples
- Style presets and color sets
- Keyboard helpers and redraw triggers
- Window title and document metadata
- Conditional rendering: `ui.if`, `ui.ifelse`, `ui.foreach`


These are essential for maintaining consistency and control across your UI system.
