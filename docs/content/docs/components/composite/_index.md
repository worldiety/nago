Composite components are made up of multiple basic elements and encapsulate more complex behavior or structure. They often represent self-contained UI units with specific functionality.

## Examples
- Date pickers and color pickers
- Multi-step forms
- Rich text editors

Use these when simple elements aren't enough, and more behavior or structure is required.
