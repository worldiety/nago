Layout components define the structure and positioning of UI elements. They help organize content spatially and ensure responsive and consistent design across different screen sizes.

## Examples
- VStack / HStack
- Box
- Grid
- ScrollView
- Frame
- Position
- Scaffold

Layout defines the *how* of structure, not the *what* of content.
