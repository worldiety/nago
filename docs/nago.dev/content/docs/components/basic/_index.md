Basic components are the fundamental building blocks of the user interface. They are simple, reusable, and commonly used across many parts of the application.

## Examples
- Buttons
- Checkboxes
- Radio buttons
- Text fields
- Labels
- Avatars

These components typically have minimal internal logic and are designed for composition into more complex structures.
