title: HStack
---
HStack is a horizontal layout container that arranges its child views in a row. It supports alignment, spacing, background styling, borders, and interaction states. The HStack is interactive if an action is defined and can respond to hover, press,
and focus states with visual feedback.

## Constructors
### HStack
HStack is a container, in which the given children will be layout in a row according to the applied
alignment rules. Note, that per definition the container clips its children. Thus, if working with shadows,
you need to apply additional padding.

## Methods
| Method | Description |
|--------| ------------|
| `AccessibilityLabel(label string)` | AccessibilityLabel sets the label used by screen readers for accessibility. |
| `Action(f func())` | Action sets the callback function to be invoked when the stack is clicked or tapped. |
| `Alignment(alignment Alignment)` | Alignment sets how the stack's children are aligned vertically within the horizontal row. |
| `Append(children ...)` | Append adds one or more child views to the horizontal stack. |
| `BackgroundColor(backgroundColor Color)` | BackgroundColor sets the background color of the horizontal stack. |
| `Border(border Border)` | Border sets the border styling of the stack. |
| `Enabled(enabled bool)` | Enabled has only an effect if StylePreset is applied, otherwise it is ignored. |
| `FocusedBackgroundColor(backgroundColor Color)` | FocusedBackgroundColor sets the background color of the stack when it is focused (e.g., via keyboard navigation). |
| `FocusedBorder(border Border)` | FocusedBorder sets the border styling when the stack is focused. |
| `Font(font Font)` | Font sets the font style applied to text content inside the stack. |
| `Frame(fr Frame)` | Frame sets the layout frame of the horizontal stack, including size and positioning. |
| `FullWidth()` | FullWidth sets the stack to span the full available width. |
| `Gap(gap Length)` | Gap sets the spacing between child views in the horizontal stack. |
| `HoveredBackgroundColor(backgroundColor Color)` | HoveredBackgroundColor sets the background color of the stack when the user hovers over it. |
| `HoveredBorder(border Border)` | HoveredBorder sets the border styling when the stack is hovered. |
| `ID(id string)` | ID assigns a unique identifier to the stack, useful for testing or referencing. |
| `NoClip(b bool)` | NoClip toggles whether the stack clips its children. By default, stacks clip their children; setting true disables clipping. |
| `Opacity(opacity float64)` | Opacity sets the visibility of this component. The range is [0..1] where 0 means fully transparent and 1 means fully visible. This also affects all contained children. |
| `Padding(padding Padding)` | Padding sets the inner spacing around the stack's children. |
| `Position(position Position)` | Position sets the position of the horizontal stack within its parent layout. |
| `PressedBackgroundColor(backgroundColor Color)` | PressedBackgroundColor sets the background color of the stack when it is pressed or clicked. |
| `PressedBorder(border Border)` | PressedBorder sets the border styling when the stack is pressed or clicked. |
| `StylePreset(preset StylePreset)` | StylePreset applies a predefined style preset to the stack, controlling its appearance. |
| `TextColor(textColor Color)` | TextColor sets the color of text content inside the stack. |
| `Visible(visible bool)` | Visible controls the visibility of the stack; setting false hides it. |
| `With(fn func(stack THStack) THStack)` | With applies a transformation function to the stack itself and returns the result. Useful for chaining configuration in a functional style. |
| `WithFrame(fn func(Frame) Frame)` | WithFrame applies a transformation function to the stack's frame and returns the updated component. |
| `Wrap(wrap bool)` | Wrap tries to reproduce the flex-box wrap behavior. This means, that if the HStack has a limited width, it must create multiple rows to place its children. Note, that the text layout behavior is unspecified (it may layout without word-wrap or use some sensible defaults). Each row and each element may have its own custom size, so this must not use a grid-like layouting. |
