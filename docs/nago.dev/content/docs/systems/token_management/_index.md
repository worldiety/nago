Token Management provides the ability to create and manage API access tokens.  
Tokens act like users: they can have groups, roles, permissions, and licenses assigned.  
This allows external applications or users to authenticate against the system and gain access to defined resources.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Tokens are primarily intended to be used with [HAPI Management](../hapi_management/).  
While APIs can also be exposed without authentication, Token Management enables secure and fine-grained access control.

## Functional areas
Token Management provides the following key functions:

### Token creation and editing
- Create, rotate, and delete tokens
- Assign groups, roles, permissions, and licenses
- Define token validity (expiration date)

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
The plaintext token is only **shown once** during creation!  
Make sure to copy and securely store it immediately.  
After closing the dialog, the token **cannot** be viewed again â€“ only rotated or deleted.

### Example: API Authentication
The most common integration is authenticating API calls with a bearer token.

```go
hapi.Get[SomeRequest](api, hapi.Operation{Path: "/api/v1/protected"}).
    Request(
        hapi.BearerAuth[SomeRequest](tokens.UseCases.AuthenticateSubject, func(dst *SomeRequest, subject auth.Subject) error {
            dst.Subject = subject
            return nil
        }),
    ).
    Response(
        hapi.ToJSON[SomeRequest, SomeResponse](func(in SomeRequest) (SomeResponse, error) {
            return SomeResponse{Message: "Access granted for " + in.Subject.ID()}, nil
        }),
    )
```

With this setup:
- A client includes the token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header
- Token Management validates the token and injects the authenticated auth.Subject
- The API can enforce access control based on the subject's roles, groups, and permissions

## Dependencies
**Requires:**
- [Group Management](../group_management/)
- [License Management](../license_management/)
- [Role Management](../role_management/)
- [User Management](../user_management/)

If these are not already active, they will be enabled automatically when Token Management is activated.

**Is required by:**
- none

## Activation
This system is activated via:
```go
std.Must(cfg.TokenManagement())
```

```go
tokenManagement := std.Must(cfg.TokenManagement())
```
