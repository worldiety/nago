Embed(buf []byte) Embed encodes the given buffer within the components attributes. This may be fine to load small images synchronously, but it may break the channel, the server or the frontend, if too large. Better use [application.Resource] for large static images. Embedding image data in the range of 100-200 byte is totally fine, though. The resource URI alone is already about 100 characters long. Usually, embedding SVGs in the range of 1-2KiB is also fine. To optimize render performance, the system uses a special caching technique. Important: due to caching, do not submit ever-changing SVGs, because the backend and the frontend may suffer from cache overflow. This will half the typical required bandwidth for icon heavy use cases. The larger the SVG, the better the effect. See also [TImage.EmbedAdaptive].

Grundsätzlich ist das System darauf ausgelegt, dass die Wahrheit über die Identität eines Nutzers im System selbst liegt. Das bleibt auch für den Fall so, wenn die Authentifizierung über externe SSO-Anbieter wie Microsoft Entra, Login-With-Amazon oder Google erfolgt. Hintergrund ist, dass solche externen Nutzer üblicherweise außerhalb jeglicher Kontrolle durch uns oder den Kunden der Plattform selbst ist. Das bedeutet, dass nicht damit gerechnet werden kann, dass der Kunde Konten deaktivieren, Gruppen oder Rollen beim SSO-Anbieter verwalten kann. Deshalb liegt das komplette Permission, Group und Role-Management im System selbst.\nIm Folgenden wird ein minimales Beispiel gezeigt, wie mit dem System gearbeitet werden kann.\nUm das Projekt standardisiert zu bauen und weitere Schritte des Buildprozesses zu automatisieren ist sowieso ein Makefile praktisch. Füge dazu den folgenden Aussschnitt deinem Makefile hinzu.\nmacro: GOPROXY=direct go run github.com/worldiety/macro/cmd/expand@latest Das System ist ein reines OptIn System, sodass natürlich auch eine komplett eigene IAM-Logik umgesetzt werden kann - empfohlen sei das an dieser Stelle aber grundsätzlich nicht.

Der vorliegende Code wurde ge-reviewed und wird zentral gepflegt.\nSchaue dir am besten die IAM-Settings genau an und was die cfg.IAM Methode im Detail macht, um deine Möglichkeiten der Anpassung auszunutzen.

This approach is especially useful when you only need a subset of systems.","list-of-systems#List of Systems":" System Description Details Admin Management It provides the Admin Center, a central hub that aggregates and displays the administration pages of all connected subsystems. Key features include:Centralized access to management systemsAutomatic integration of built-in systems (User, Role, Session, Permission, etc. )Role- and permission-based access controlExtensibility by allowing developers to register custom groups and cards Details » Backup Management It provides access to backup and restore functionality in Nago. It includes use cases for creating backups, restoring from backups, exporting the master key, and replacing the master key. UseCases:Backup: Creates a full backup of the application. Encrypted stores remain encrypted; the master key is not included. - Restore: Restores the application state from a backup file. This overwrites existing data. Encrypted stores require the master key. - ExportMasterKey: Returns the current Nago master key, required to decrypt encrypted stores in backups. - ReplaceMasterKey: Replaces the current master key. Encrypted stores can only be decrypted after restart with the new key. Details » Drive Management It provides a file storage and file management subsystem that can be used from both frontend UI components and backend use-cases. The system implements an owner/group/permission model. Files contain Owner, Group and FileMode fields, and permission checks are implemented in File. CanRead, File. CanWrite, File. CanDelete, and File. CanRename. Shares and resource-level permissions are also considered by the permission checks. Use the provided use-cases (drive. OpenRoot, drive. Put, drive. MkDir, drive. Delete, drive. Stat, drive. Zip, drive. Get, drive. Rename) to integrate Drive into your application logic or to expose it through custom APIs. Details » Group Management It provides UseCases for creating and managing user groups. Groups are used to bundle users together and control access to certain pages or resources. They can be created, edited, and deleted via UI or code. Group membership is managed through UserManagement. A special “System” group is created automatically for internal services and is not intended for real users. Details » Image Management It provides backend functionality for storing, processing, and serving images. Images are represented as SrcSets, which contain multiple scaled variants (e. g. , thumbnails, previews, high-resolution versions) of the same source. Features:Validation of uploaded images (file size, supported format, dimensions)Creation of SrcSets with automatically generated downscaled variantsDeduplication of image data in the underlying blob storeBest-fit selection of images for given dimensions and object-fit strategiesSecure opening of image readers with permission-aware access controlDefault HTTP endpoint (/api/nago/v1/image) for image delivery, including caching Details » Mail Management It is responsible for sending emails within the platform, including notifications, password resets, and user registration confirmations. It requires an SMTP secret configured SecretManagement. and uses predefined templates from TemplateManagement, which can be customized as needed. Details » Permission Management It is responsible for managing permission. Permission. These are the most fine-grained access control unit in the system. They are always defined at development time in code, and cannot be created or modified at runtime. Permissions can be granted to individual users or roles. Details » Role Management It provides UseCases for creating, editing, deleting roles. Roles are used to grant users bundled permissions. They can be created, edited, and deleted via UI or code. Roles assignment is managed through UserManagement. Details » Scheduler Management It provides centralized management of background processes (schedulers). Developers can register recurring or one-shot jobs at application startup, monitor their execution, and interact with them through the Admin Center UI. Details » Secret Management It is responsible for storing, managing, and controlling access to sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and external system configurations. It stores all data in an encrypted blob store and allows secure sharing with other users or groups. Typical workflows include:Creating, updating, and deleting secretsSharing secrets with users or groupsDefining new secret types in the source code by implementing the secret. Credentials interface. Details » Session Management It provides functionality for handling user sessions, including login, logout, authentication state, and Single Sign-On (SSO) via the Nago Login Service (NLS). A session is identified by a unique cookie-based ID and represents the persistent state of a client. This ID is stable across tabs and device restarts. Key features include:Session lifecycle management (create, find, clear, timeout handling)Authentication via email/password or direct user IDSingle Sign-On support (start, exchange, refresh NLS flows)Logout and session invalidationTracking of creation and authentication timestampsStoring small key-value pairs in session context Details » Settings Management It provides centralized configuration for global and per-user settings and has two main responsibilities: 1. Manage general application-level user settings such as:free registration (enable/disable)forgot password functionalitydomain whitelist for registrationdefault roles and groups for new and anonymous usersUser Management: GDPR consent textsTheme Management: global theme configurationSchedule Management: job lifetime and cleanup rules Details » Template Management It is responsible for creating, editing, and managing reusable templates. It provides a centralized way to separate content from code and supports multiple output formats, including Go HTML templates for emails, plain text, and various text-to-PDF workflows (Typst, LaTeX, AsciiDoc). The system is primarily used by other modules such as Mail Management for standardized emails, but can also support document generation (e. g. , reports, certificates, invoices). By centralizing template logic, it increases flexibility, maintainability, and consistency across the platform. Details » Theme Management Theme Management handles the configuration of theme and corporate identity settings. It allows to define logos and app icons (for dark and light mode), configure legal information (e. g. Impressum, Privacy Policy, Terms, User Agreement), and set provider contact details such as responsible entity, contact email, and API documentation URL. Additionally, developers can define fonts and base colors (main, interactive, accent) directly via code. Colors can differ between dark and light mode. Details » Token Management It configures and provides the backend for managing API access tokens. Tokens are used to authenticate requests against REST APIs. They can carry groups, roles, permissions, and licenses, similar to regular users. This enables external applications or services to act as authenticated subjects. It is typically used together with cfghapi. Management to secure API endpoints with bearer tokens. Details » User Management It is responsible for creating, managing, and maintaining user accounts within the platform. It provides both administrative and self-service features, allowing administrators to manage users and permissions, while enabling end users to maintain their own profiles. Typical workflows include:Creating and deleting user accountsAssigning roles, groups, and permissionsManaging user profile data and contact detailsPassword management (self-service and administrative)Email verification and account activation notifications. Details » ","note-on-system-dependencies#Note on System dependencies":"Some systems internally activate other systems they depend on. For example, SessionManagement() will automatically enable UserManagement(), MailManagement() and some more.
