/**
* A ConfigurationDefined event is the response to a [ConfigurationRequested] event.
According to the locale request, string and svg resources can be localized by the backend. The returned locale is the actually picked locale from the requested locale query string.

It looks quite obfuscated, however this minified version is intentional, because it may succeed each transaction call.
A frontend may request acknowledges for each event, e.g. while typing in a text field, so this premature optimization is likely a win.
