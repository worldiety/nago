 * A ConfigurationDefined event is the response to a [ConfigurationRequested] event.
 * According to the locale request, string and svg resources can be localized by the backend.
 * The returned locale is the actually picked locale from the requested locale query string.
 * 
 * It looks quite obfuscated, however this minified version is intentional, because it may succeed each transaction call.
 * A frontend may request acknowledges for each event, e.g. while typing in a text field, so this premature optimization is likely a win.
