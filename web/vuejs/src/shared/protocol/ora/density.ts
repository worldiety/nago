 * Density describes the scale factor of physical pixels to screen pixels normalized to a 160dpi screen.
 * This is identical to the Android specification. On a 160dpi screen, this factor is 1. Note, that
 * this may also be used to optimize accessibility which makes everything equally larger. There is also the
 * concept of SP, but that is usually implemented at the frontend interpreter anyway.
